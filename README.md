# powerplant-coding-challenge

This is my implementation of the coding challenge.

The API folder contains the web API including a SignalR hub. Details about the approach to solve the issue are documented as comments with the algorithm.

The Client folder contains a SignalR client which connects to the API and reports on any production plan requests.
